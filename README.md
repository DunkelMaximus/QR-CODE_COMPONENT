### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to properly approach a challenge and how to think before starting it. I initially planned on all the ways to complete this challenge and chose the idea which I most preferred.

I also learned that it is best to complete the html part first and then proceed with styling it. This made the challenge much more fun and simpler.
